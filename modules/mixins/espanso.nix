                Can you please mention the authors of the script, like advised in the issue template?
                You will find the authors in the *Script repository*.
                Don't forget to use the `@` symbol to mention them.

                Thank you for reporting.
                Can you please post the output from the *Debug settings* in the settings dialog? You just need to paste it here.
                And is there any useful log output if you enable the log panel (see Window / Panels)?
                Please make sure you also enable debug logging in the log panel by right-clicking on the panel and selecting `Debug` in `Options`.
                The issue dialog in the help menu can help you with all of that.
